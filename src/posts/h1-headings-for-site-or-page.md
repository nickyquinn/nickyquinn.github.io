# Should I use H1 for website title, or individual page headings?

I was recently contacted by friends who had an SEO audit done on their website, and one of the items that was raised was that they were using an H1 or 'Heading 1' tag for the name of their website, and using H2 tags for titles of individual pages.

According to the SEO company, this is bad practice, and can have a negative impact on SEO.

**But is there any truth in that?**
